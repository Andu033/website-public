Check default widgets for each class.

Check empty fields; does toggle work?

Need some sort of simple list macro to display small lists of objetcts not requiring data table.

Generic, ubiquitous, and intuitive sequence downloads.


Standardize Overview widgets.


Species display and internal linking.
      display should be consistent: G. species, italiczied, and linked when it's one of ours.

Phenotypes:
* Standardize processing
  * Variation.pm has unique processing that could be slotted into the Role.
  * Gene.pm uses the flat files. ugh.
* Macros could be moved to shared/widgets/phenotypes.tt2
* shared widget could be expanded to include special cases like variation/phenotypes.tt2


tag2link
* Fails in some cases (or fails to provide generic "all" for classes/objects that are missing species)

Central Dogma display
* replace gene models on gene
* also make available on Sequence and protein.
* Maybe retire the sequence page? Or merge with clone?

Consistency of Overview widgets:
     H1 header?
     hilight box and contents?

Purge template identifier (or fix) at the top of each template


References widget / handling

* use the xapian search or refernece XREFs in ace?
* if using xapian, what impact does this have on API?
* are the xapian search results sensible?
* Role::Object::references() already exists but needs to be
  expanded (ie to make it easier to sort references by year or type)
  As it is, it simply returns a packed list of reference objects.
* Be sure to include pseudo-POD in models that use references()
* can probably purge convenience methods in Role::Object (such as meeting_abstracts)
* The publications template of person has some rudimentary 
  formatting (and the corresponding method some logic).

General UI:
Class summary pages.
      * make sure search/browse works for classes


API
* Drop pseudoPOD and just document public methods in Role?
* Documentation CGI can set up POD where appropriate.x
* set up api.wormbase.org


Temporary images
* Are paths correct and portable to different environments?
* Is generating server in URL for load balancing? Or should we just write to NFS?

GBrowse
* integration
* links
* branding

Class-level summary widgets.
* Are URLs correct? Seeing requests like:
    CACHE: rest/widget/laboratory//all_labs: NOT PRESENT; generating widget.
* Species-associated class level widgets (strain) not working.
