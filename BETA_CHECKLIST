Species display and internal linking.
      display should be consistent: G. species, italiczied, and linked when it's one of ours.

tag2link
* Fails in some cases (or fails to provide generic "all" for classes/objects that are missing species)

Central Dogma display
* replace gene models on gene
* also make available on Sequence and protein.
* Maybe retire the sequence page? Or merge with clone?

Consistency of Overview widgets:
     H1 header?
     hilight box and contents?

Purge template identifier (or fix) at the top of each template


References widget / handling

* use the xapian search or refernece XREFs in ace?
* if using xapian, what impact does this have on API?
* are the xapian search results sensible?
* Role::Object::references() already exists but needs to be
  expanded (ie to make it easier to sort references by year or type)
  As it is, it simply returns a packed list of reference objects.
* Be sure to include pseudo-POD in models that use references()
* can probably purge convenience methods in Role::Object (such as meeting_abstracts)
* The publications template of person has some rudimentary 
  formatting (and the corresponding method some logic).


API
* Drop pseudoPOD and just document public methods in Role?
* Documentation CGI can set up POD where appropriate.x
* set up api.wormbase.org


Temporary images
* paths
* generating server for load balancing or NFS

GBrowse
* integration
* links
* branding

Class-level summary widgets.
* Are URLs correct? Seeing requests like:
    CACHE: rest/widget/laboratory//all_labs: NOT PRESENT; generating widget.
* Species-associated class level widgets (strain) not working.
