The following data access and formatting needs to be standardized; some
already are partially standardized:
    GO_term, Phenotype

Check default widgets for each class.

Check empty fields; does toggle work?


Tree display is broken - Todd

Todd
Need some sort of simple list macro to display small lists of objetcts not requiring data table.
     In cases where the number of items is large, should also provide a link to download as CSV
     So far: list_objects & link_objects, two methods for generating a simple list (of hashes of objects created by _pack_objects
     or of manually created list of objects.

     _pack_objects and list_object/link_objects is kind of bizarre.
     * pack_objects expects array ref and returns hashref (see above; used for sorting in view)
     * checking for def/undef in order to hide empty fields in kind of odd and not 100% consistent...
     
Generic, ubiquitous, and intuitive sequence downloads. TODD

Error reporting: to user, to staff.  Formatting.
    Ajax errors loading widgets trickle through and report "oops" but aren't caught?

    Calling URLs that SHOULD result in 404s do NOT.
      http://todd.wormbase.org/species/todd -> returns 500, not 404
      http://todd.wormbase.org/specis/todd  -> return 404, with different formatting.


Standardize Overview widgets.


Species display and internal linking.
      display should be consistent: G. species, italiczied, and linked when it's one of ours.

Phenotypes:
* Standardize processing
  * Variation.pm has unique processing that could be slotted into the Role.
  * Gene.pm uses the flat files. ugh.
* Macros could be moved to shared/widgets/phenotypes.tt2
* shared widget could be expanded to include special cases like variation/phenotypes.tt2


tag2link
* Fails in some cases (or fails to provide generic "all" for classes/objects that are missing species)

Central Dogma display
* replace gene models on gene
* also make available on Sequence and protein.
* Maybe retire the sequence page? Or merge with clone?

Consistency of Overview widgets:
     H1 header?
     hilight box and contents?

Purge template identifier (or fix) at the top of each template


References widget / handling

  * use the xapian search or refernece XREFs in ace?
  * if using xapian, what impact does this have on API?
  * are the xapian search results sensible?
  * Role::Object::references() already exists but needs to be
    expanded (ie to make it easier to sort references by year or type)
    As it is, it simply returns a packed list of reference objects.
  * Be sure to include pseudo-POD in models that use references()
  * can probably purge convenience methods in Role::Object (such as meeting_abstracts)
  * The publications template of person has some rudimentary 
    formatting (and the corresponding method some logic).
  * wormbase.conf might need to be updated if using XREFd references and the inherted references().
      In particular, need to make sure that each References widget includes the "fields references"
      to ensure the data structure is populated.

General UI:
Class summary pages.
      * make sure search/browse works for classes



API
* Drop pseudoPOD and just document public methods in Role?
* Documentation CGI can set up POD where appropriate.x
* set up api.wormbase.org


Temporary images
* Are paths correct and portable to different environments?
* Is generating server in URL for load balancing? Or should we just write to NFS?

GBrowse - Abby
* integration
* links
* branding

Class-level summary widgets.
* Are URLs correct? Seeing requests like:
    CACHE: rest/widget/laboratory//all_labs: NOT PRESENT; generating widget.
* Species-associated class level widgets (strain) not working.
