<!-- START [% title %] section -->	

<!-- In the Classic view originally, there was one monolithic table
     This was too difficult to maintain in a panel approach. To restore,
     move the table start and end out of start_section / end_section
-->

THIS IS NOT IN USE ANY LONGER IS IT?
<tr class="databody" valign="top">	
    <th class="searchtitle" colspan="2" width="125px">
	<a name="[% title %]">[% title FILTER ucfirst %]</a>

    <td>
    <table border="0" cellspacing="4" cellpadding="0">
         [% content %]
