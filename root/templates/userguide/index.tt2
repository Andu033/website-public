<h2>Available User Guides</h2>

<p>We've created three user guides for different interest and experience levels.</p>

<h3>Users</h3>

<p>
Most users will find something of interest in the main User's Guide 
outlining the structure, data, and tools available to WormBase.</p>

<p>
Those wishing to use WormBase in a teaching setting will find tips and 
tricks in the Educators Guide.</p>

<h3>Developers</h3>

<p>Finally, those wishing to develop tools to leverage the data and infrastructure
of WormBase should read through the Developer's Guide.</p>
