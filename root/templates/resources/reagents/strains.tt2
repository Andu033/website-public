The ''Caenorhabditis'' Genetics Center ([http://www.cbs.umn.edu/CGC/CGChomepage.htm CGC]) is supported by the National Institutes of Health - National Center for Research Resources. The CGC has been in operation since 1978, first at the University of Missouri, Columbia and since 1992 at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities.
