# The validation script performs a wide range of checks. Some of these
# checks are fatal and recorded as "errors". However, some of the checks
# can be configured to be recorded as "warnings". The following parameters
# allows for this customization.
#
# In order to customize a check, set it to "W" for warning and to "E" for
# error.

# Data is loaded to the database in chunks rather than individually.
# A buffer is used to store a set number of records before they are
# dumped into the database. This is done to improve loading speed. This
# parameter defines the maximum allowed number of records kept in
# this buffer at any time.

# During processing a log file is generated to keep track of progress.
# For some processes, a message is recorded in the log file describing
# how many entries have been processed so far. This is not dome for
# every record (as this would generate a very large log file). Instead
# logging is done every "line_number_chunk" records.

# A GFF3 file must have its sources coming from an ontology. The GFF3 specs
# state that, if an ontology (or ontologies) are provided using the
# ##feature-ontology directive, the ontology/ontologies are used. If none is
# provided, the default SOFA ontology is used. The following parameters
# describes the URL for this default ontology.

                            # This corresponds to SOFA Release 2

# If the GFF3 file contatins an ontology directive that refers to a file that
