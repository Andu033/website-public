	The ORFeome project designs primer assays for spliced mRNAs and then performs sequence reads
	on rtPCR material, producing "OSTs."  This track shows ORFeome project OSTs aligned to the
	<i>C. elegans</i> genome using Jim Kent's BLAT program
	[<a href="http://genome.cse.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgBlat">http://genome.cse.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgBlat</a>].
	This track shows the best unique location for each OST.
