This directory contains application and server specific
log files.

The following application-specific logs are created
when you launch your app via:

  ./script/wormbase_server.pl -p PORT -d -r

  wormbase-catalyst-access.log
      Catalyst access and debugging log.
  
  wormbase-catalyst-cache.log
      Catalyst CHI cache log.

  wormbase-catalyst-queries.log
      Catalyst log that records queries from the AQL/WQL page.


Several additional logs are created when the app is run under
starman via:

  ./script/wormbase-init.sh

  wormbase-starman-access.log
       Starman's apache style access log. Should be rotated.

  wormbase-starman-error.log
       Starman's error log. If STARMAN_DEBUG=1 is set in your
       environment this log will also capture additional debug
       messages.

Finally, if the starman and the application are run from a
start_server daemon via the startup script, two additional
files will appear:

  ./script/wormbase-daemon.sh

  wormbase.status
  Used by Server::Starter (and start_server) to monitor app processes.

  wormbase.pid
  PID of the parent process.
